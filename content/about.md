# Helloooo (Again), my name is Laurence.

I'm an eager programmer and eager learner from California. I'm incredibly passionate about video games, game development, and programming/graphic techniques within that area.

My main interest is in the gameplay area of development. I've always admired how gameplay mechanics and sound design can create immersive experiences and excellent game feel.

Want to get to know me more or discuss job opportunities - [Toss me a line](mailto:sirlaurence@protonmail.com)
