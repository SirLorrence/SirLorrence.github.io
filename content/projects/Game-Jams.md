## Project Info
During the 2024 game jam, my two friends and I came together to create a game called "Serious Business, Silly Deliveries". Initially, we had planned to design a horror game set in an amusement park, but we realized it was too complex and needed to be simplified to fit the theme. After hours of brainstorming and bouncing off fun ideas, we decided on the perfect concept for our game - make your boss laugh, but try not to get fired.

**This project was a learning experience for me as I typically plan and structure my code to be clean, open, and reusable. However, for this game jam, I had to adapt to a new approach of "just make it work without blowing up," which was more suitable for the time constraints. I have started incorporating this method into my personal and some professional projects, but I always go back to clean up the code afterwards.**

## Project Info

This was my first game jam during my first year of college in Nova Scotia. I spent the week meeting rad programmers, managed a team for the first time, and got to make a fun game. Here, I discovered I enjoy making games and enjoy it much more working with a team of passionate people.
